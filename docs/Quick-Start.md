# Quick Start Guide - Community Edition

{: .warning }
This version applies to the Community Edition of SWIRL!

* To run SWIRL in Docker, you must have the latest [Docker app](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for MacOS, Linux, or Windows installed and running locally.

* Windows users must first install and configure either the WSL 2 or the Hyper-V backend, as outlined in the  [System Requirements for installing Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/#system-requirements).

{: .warning }
Make sure the Docker app is running before proceeding!

* Download [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swirlai/swirl-search/main/docker-compose.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swirlai/swirl-search/main/docker-compose.yaml)

``` shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swirlai/swirl-search/main/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yaml
```

* *IMPORTANT*: To use SWIRL's Real-Time Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in Docker, run the following commands from the Console using a valid OpenAI API key...

For Mac OS or Linux:
``` shell
export MSAL_CB_PORT=8000
export MSAL_HOST=localhost
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-OpenAI-API-key>
```

For Windows:
``` shell
set MSAL_CB_PORT=8000
set MSAL_HOST=localhost
set OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-OpenAI-API-key>
```

{: .highlight }
Check out [OpenAI's YouTube video](https://youtu.be/nafDyRsVnXU?si=YpvyaRvhX65vtBrb) if you don't have an OpenAI API Key.

* On MacOS or Linux, run the following command from the Console:

``` shell
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up
```

* On Windows, run the following command from PowerShell:

``` shell
docker compose up
```

After a few minutes, the following or similar should appear:

``` shell
